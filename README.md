This is a Telegram bot for simulating the cases opening (wishes from Genshin Impact). This is my very first project, which I made two years ago. It has been deliberately left almost unchanged (the code is in very poor condition and barely works) so that after reworking it, I can see all the progress from start to finish. UPD: The original version was lost due to my inexperience, so the first version now has an almost fixed keyboard.
